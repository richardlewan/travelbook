# travelbook
A simple app that allows a user to mark Places (locations) on a Google map. The selected Place will be named by its street address and stored in the SQLlite DB. On restarting the app, the stored Places are loaded from the DB and will appear in a ListView. Clicking on any named place in the ListView will take the user to that Place marker on the Map Activity.
